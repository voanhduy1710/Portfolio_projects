## ðŸŽ¯ Key Metrics & Dimensions

**â€¢ Revenue:** Total income generated from sales across all products and customer segments.

**â€¢ Profit:** Earnings after subtracting all costs.

**â€¢ Return Rate:** Percentage of sold items that customers returned; indicates satisfaction and product quality.

**â€¢ MoM Changes:** Month-over-month changes in revenue, profit, and other KPIs to monitor trends.

**â€¢ Distribution:** by Category, Segment over time


## ðŸ’¡ Summary of Insights

â€¢ In 2017, the business supported 693 customers and maintained a strong retention rate of 98.41%, with an average revenue of $950 per user. The Consumer segment played a major role in this performance, reflecting high customer loyalty and a concentrated customer base

â€¢ A subset of products consistently contributes to a large portion of total sales. Identifying and focusing on these high-performing items can optimize revenue.

â€¢ Sales performance varies across different regions, highlighting the importance of region-specific marketing and distribution strategies.

â€¢ ICertain products exhibit slow inventory turnover, indicating potential overstocking issues that tie up capital and storage resources.

â€¢ Analysis reveals delays in the supply chain, particularly in the procurement and distribution phases, affecting overall efficiency.


## âœ… Recommendations and next steps

â€¢ Regional performance differences suggest the need for localized strategies. If, for instance, 60% of sales originate from one or two key regions, then marketing efforts and distribution logistics should be focused accordingly to reinforce that advantage and explore underperforming areas.

â€¢ Inventory turnover analysis also reveals that certain products are moving slower than others, potentially tying up thousands of dollars in idle capital. Regular audits and a threshold policy (e.g., flagging items with turnover rates below 2x per year) can help free up space and funds for faster-moving stock.

â€¢  Customer concentration in the Consumer segment indicates risk if demand shifts. Diversifying into adjacent customer segmentsâ€”such as Small Business or B2B clientsâ€”could create a more balanced and resilient revenue base. Piloting this with just around 15% of current marketing budget could validate the opportunity without large upfront risk.
